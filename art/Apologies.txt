I apologize...

I was VERY stubborn in the past when I made my first FNF mod. I rejected criticism and thought that anyone who was criticizing my art is just trying to harass me.

But now I see what I did wrong.

So, I'm sorry, and I will try to take criticism as best as I can.

This mod remaster is made by me taking old and new criticism on my first mod and actually use them to make a better mod.
